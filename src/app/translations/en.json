  "bio": "As an artist, I explore the interplay between light, shadow, and narrative through theatrical still-life compositions. My work transforms ordinary objects into intimate vignettes that evoke curiosity and invite quiet reflection. Each piece carries a sense of mystery, where textures, colors, and forms converge to tell subtle yet compelling stories.\n\nInspired by the delicate balance between realism and imagination, I aim to create moments where light breathes life into the mundane. My paintings delve into themes of stillness, nostalgia, and connection, employing layers of richly textured oil paint to build depth and emotion. These imagined worlds are imbued with a quiet tension, where the relationships between objects suggest deeper, untold narratives.\n\nLiving and working in France, I draw inspiration from the charm of everyday surroundings, imbuing my work with warmth and universality. Through my art, I seek to create contemplative spaces that inspire curiosity and uncover the beauty and mystery hidden in simplicity.",
