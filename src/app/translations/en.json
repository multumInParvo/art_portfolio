  "bio": "I’m an artist born in 1987, Ukraine, raised in Argentina, and living in France.",
  "artistStatement-01": "Through my self-taught practice, I create theatrical still-life compositions that transform everyday objects—figurines, plants, and domestic items—into intimate narratives. By exploring the interplay of light, shadow, and a carefully curated, limited color palette to create harmonious color relationships, I aim to evoke curiosity and a quiet sense of mystery.",
  "artistStatement-02": "Working with layered oil paints, my work reflects themes of stillness, nostalgia, and connection. Rooted in my surroundings and personal experiences, I strive to reveal beauty in simplicity and invite viewers to pause, reflect, and discover their own interpretations within the quiet drama of everyday moments.",
