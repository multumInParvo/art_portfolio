  "bio": "Oleksandr Pryvalov (b. 1987) grew up in Mykolaiv, Ukraine, and later discovered his artistic voice in Argentina before settling in France, where he continues to nurture his passion for oil painting. A self-taught artist, Pryvalov recreates small worlds in his work, populating them with ordinary personages—plants, figurines, everyday objects—and giving them life through extraordinary stories. Each of his paintings is a carefully constructed still-life narrative, where every object becomes a character with its own presence and purpose. Whether it’s a porcelain chicken, an owl figurine, a vibrant orchid, or a humble pumpkin, Pryvalov’s personages interact with one another in subtle, mysterious ways, inviting the viewer to explore their quiet relationships. His masterful use of light and shadow enhances this sense of theatricality, emphasizing textures, forms, and the emotional tones of the scene. Drawing inspiration from both classical traditions and contemporary aesthetics, Pryvalov uses a minimalistic yet vibrant palette to create harmony between his personages and their settings. His compositions often integrate cultural motifs, symbolic objects, and textiles, infusing each work with layers of meaning and connecting the personal with the universal. Through his art, Pryvalov elevates the ordinary, offering viewers a window into small, imagined worlds that invite reflection and inspire curiosity. His paintings are quiet invitations to step into these worlds, to pause and uncover the beauty and stories hidden in stillness.",
